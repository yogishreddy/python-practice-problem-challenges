"""Description:-
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT with given steps. 
Please write a program to compute the distance from the current position after a sequence of movements and the original point. 
If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Input Format:
The first line of input consists of one string and one integer
The second line of input consists of one string and one integer
Same for the other new lines until the user enters a "STOP".
Output Format:
The output consists of an integer value which is the distance between points.
Sample Input 1:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
STOP
Sample Output 1:
2
