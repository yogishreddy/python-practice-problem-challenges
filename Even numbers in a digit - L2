"""Description:-
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between the user-given range (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Input Format:
The first input consists of an integer type to get starting value.
The second input consists of an integer type to get the ending value.
Output Format:
The output consists of all even digit numbers from the given range separated by a comma. If the range is out of bound, print "Invalid Input".
Constraints:
1>=n,m<=5000
Sample Input 1:
81
101
Sample Output 1:
82,84,86,88
Sample Input 2:
1
