Program:-
H=30
C=50
temp=[]
l = list(map(int,input().strip().split(',')))
for i in l:
    Q=pow((2*C*i)/H,0.5)
    temp.append(int(Q))
print((',').join(map(str,temp)))

Description:-
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]. 
Following are the fixed values of C and H: C is 50. H is 30. D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
Input
100,150,180
output
18,22,24
